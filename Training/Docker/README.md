# Docker
The directories below contain Terraform configuration files to setup training labs for the official Docker training classes I have attended.

The [Introduction to Docker](Introduction-to-Docker) and [Advanced Docker Topics](Advanced-Docker-Topics) courses correspond to the 4-day Docker Administration & Operations class by Vizuri I took in Atlanta in December 2016.

The [Enterprise Operations](Enterprise-Operations) and [Accredited Consultant](Accredited-Consultant) courses correspond to the 4-day Docker Accredited Consultant class by Docker I took in San Francisco in March 2017.

The presentations and documentation for these classes can be in the Files section of our [Microsoft Teams site](https://teams.microsoft.com) under Business Solutions team.
